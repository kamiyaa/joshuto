# Image Thumbnails in File Previews

Joshuto does not support image previews directly.
One reason is that Joshuto wants to stay independent of specific display protocols and terminal emulators.

However, Joshuto offers two preview-related hooks which allow to easily implement an
image preview with some simple scripts.
The hooks can be configured in the `joshuto.toml` file.
```toml
[preview]
...
preview_shown_hook_script = "~/path/to/some/executable_script_1"
preview_removed_hook_script = "~/path/to/some/executable_script_2"
```
The shown-hook is called whenever a new file-preview (in the 3rd pane) is activated.

The removed-hook will be called each time the file preview panel
completely disappears in Joshuto.
That is the case if the user selects a file for which no file preview is shown
(either due to missing output of the preview script or due to file size),
if the preview is not cached already and the preview pane is temporarily removed,
or if the selection jumps from a file to a directory.

The ‚Äúshown‚Äù script gets the path of the file being previewed
as first argument and then the x and y coordinate and the width an
height of the preview area as second to fifth parameters.

The ‚Äúremoved‚Äù script does not get any arguments.

Using these hook, one can trigger various actions when moving the cursor along files in Joshuto,
and they can also be used to show image previews by the help of other 3rd party tools.

Keep in mind that the result of the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù `preview` script you use for textual previews
is cached by Joshuto and is not called every time a file is focused, but the ‚Äúshown‚Äù hook is.

# Wrapper Script
For some of the 3rd party tools, it's necessary 
to run them as a separate process, in parallel to Joshuto.

One famous example is ‚Äú√úberzug‚Äù. To be able to use such a solution,
one need to have a ‚Äúwrapper-script‚Äù which must be started instead of Joshuto.
The wrapper-script will then start both, first the program for showing images
in the terminal and then Joshuto.

## Numbered commands
You can prefix some commands with a number. For this, just start entering
a number and then press any key which is mapped to a command. Currently
supported commands are:
  - `cursor_move_up`: moves cursor up by number of lines you prefixed the
    command with
  - `cursor_move_down`: moves cursor down by number of lines you prefixed the
    command with
  - `g`: this is hard-coded, you cannot remap this command. Just enter a number
    and then press `g` to jump to n'th line

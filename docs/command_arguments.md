# Command Line Arguments

```
usage: joshuto [options] [path]
```

- `[path]`: tells joshuto to start in a specific directory

Joshuto supports the following options from the command line:

- `-v` `--version`: outputs version of joshuto

- `-h` `--help`: shows help menu

- `--change-directory`: sets the quit behavior to change directory instead of
  noop when closing the last tab
  - Requires shell script function to work, see [here](https://github.com/kamiyaa/joshuto/blob/main/docs/configuration/keymap.toml.md#quit-quit-joshuto)

- `--output-file <output-file>`: tells joshuto to output data to `<output-file>`.
  - This is usually used so programs can know how to behave after joshuto exits.
  - For example, cd into joshuto's current directory on quit

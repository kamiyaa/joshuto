Feel free to open a pull request!

## Some General Rules

- Please make sure the code is formatted with `cargo fmt` to keep a consistent code style.
- Try to squash useless commits into more useful commits
  - Commits such as code formatting, code cleanups, fixing a feature that hasn't been merged can be merged into one commit for the original feature
- Try to have somewhat informative commit messages

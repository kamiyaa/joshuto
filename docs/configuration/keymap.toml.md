# keymap.toml
This file is for mapping keyboard keys to commands.

```toml
mapcommand = [
    { keys = [ "T" ], command = "new_tab" },
    # ...
]
```

For more examples, take a look at [config/keymap.toml](https://github.com/kamiyaa/joshuto/blob/main/config/keymap.toml)

# Keys available:

To combine keys with Ctrl and Alt, simply have `ctrl+key`/`alt+key`
where `key` is a valid key.

In addition to the standard alphabet, Joshuto currently also support
the following keys.
```sh
backspace
backtab     # this is shift+tab
arrow_left
arrow_right
arrow_up
arrow_down
home
end
page_up
page_down
delete
insert
escape
f1
f2
f3
f4
f5
f6
f7
f8
f9
f10
f11
f12
```

# Commands available:

- [General](#general)
- [Navigation](#navigation)
- [Tabs](#tabs)
- [Search](#search)
- [Misc](#misc)

## General
 - `quit`: quit joshuto
   - will not quit if there are pending IO work (paste jobs)
   - `quit --force`: does ***NOT*** wait for pending IO work
   - `quit --output-current-directory`: if `--output-file` argument is set, output the current directory to it
   - `quit --output-selected-files`: if `--output-file` argument is set, output the selected files to it

`quit` works best with the following bash script
```bash
function joshuto() {
	ID="$$"
	mkdir -p /tmp/$USER
	OUTPUT_FILE="/tmp/$USER/joshuto-cwd-$ID"
	env joshuto --output-file "$OUTPUT_FILE" $@
	exit_code=$?

	case "$exit_code" in
		# regular exit
		0)
			;;
		# output contains current directory
		101)
			JOSHUTO_CWD=$(cat "$OUTPUT_FILE")
			cd "$JOSHUTO_CWD"
			;;
		# output selected files
		102)
			;;
		*)
			echo "Exit code: $exit_code"
			;;
	esac
}
```

 - `:`: opens the command prompt
   - this does not execute the command, but merely sets the text to it
   - Example: `:cd /` will open up the command prompt with `cd /` already written

 - `shell`: runs a shell command
   - Example: `:shell touch file.txt` will create a file called `file.txt`
 - `spawn`: runs a shell command in the background

 - `sort`: change the sort method
    - `sort lexical`: sort lexically (`10.txt` comes before `2.txt`)
    - `sort natural`: sort naturally (`2.txt` comes before `10.txt`)
    - `sort mtime`: sort via last modified time
    - `sort reverse`: reverse the sorting

 - `show_workers`: show the pending IO operations and the current progress
    - press `escape` to exit view
 - `toggle_hidden`: toggle hidden files
 - `line_nums`: switch displaying of entry numbers
    - `line_nums 0` or `line_nums none`: disable displaying
    - `line_nums 1` or `line_nums absolute`: enable absolute numbers for each entry
    - `line_nums 2` or `line_nums relative`: enable numbers relative to selected entry

## Navigation
 - `cursor_move_up`: moves the cursor up by x amount
    - `cursor_move_up`: moves the cursor up by 1
    - `cursor_move_up x`: moves the cursor up by `x` where `x` is a non-negative number

 - `cursor_move_down`: moves the cursor down by x amount
    - `cursor_move_down`: moves the cursor down by 1
    - `cursor_move_down x`: moves the cursor down by `x` where `x` is a non-negative number

 - `cursor_move_home`: moves cursor to beginning of directory list
 - `cursor_move_end`: moves cursor to end of directory list
 - `cursor_move_page_up`: moves the cursor up by `x`
   - where `x` is the number of items that can be seen on the screen
 - `cursor_move_page_down`: moves the cursor down by `x`
   - where `x` is the number of items that can be seen on the screen

 - `parent_cursor_move_up`: same as `cursor_move_up` but for parent directory
 - `parent_cursor_move_down`: same as `cursor_move_down` but for parent directory

 - `preview_cursor_move_up`: moves the preview up
 - `preview_cursor_move_down`: moves the preview down

 - `cd`: change directory
   - `cd ..`: go to parent directory
   - `cd ~`: go to home directory
   - `cd -`: go to previous directory in history (If it exists)
 - `open`: open file or directory
   - if joshuto does not know how to open the file format (via extension currently),
   it will prompt `:open_with ` to open with a specific command
   - if `xdg_open` is `true` in [joshuto.toml](https://github.com/kamiyaa/joshuto),
   joshuto will try to open it via xdg settings
 - `subdir_fzf`: go to a subdirectory via fzf


## Tabs
 - `new_tab`: opens a new tab
    - new tab opens in home directory
 - `close_tab`: close current tab
 - `tab_switch`: switch to next/previous tab by `x`
    - where `x` is an integer
    - `tab_switch 1`: go to next tab
    - `tab_switch -1`: go to previous tab
 - `tab_switch_index`: switch to a given tab index
    - `tab_switch_index 3`: go to third tab if it exists,
    create one if it does not exist and there is already 3 - 1 = 2 tabs open

## File Operations

 - `reload_dirlist`: reloads the current directory listing
 - `mkdir`: create a new directory (usually used as `:mkdir `)
 - `cut_files`: store selected files (or current file if none were selected) to be moved later
 - `copy_files`: store selected files (or current file if none were selected) to be copied later
 - `paste_files`: move/copy files stored from a previous `cut_files` or `copy_files` command
 - `delete_files`: delete selected files (or current file if none were selected).
    - will ***permanently*** delete files if `use_trash` is `false` in
    [joshuto.toml](https://github.com/kamiyaa/joshuto)/wiki/Configuration#joshutotoml)
    - if `use_trash` is `true`, this might cause issues with deleting files
    on mounted filesystems such as on an external hard drive or tmpfs
 - `rename`: rename the current file the cursor is on
    - `:rename new_name`
 - `rename_append`: opens the command prompt with the rename command and the current file name filled in.
    - cursor will be set right before the extension of the file
    (end of file name if no extension)
 - `rename_prepend`: opens the command prompt with the rename command and the current file name filled in.
    - cursor will be set to the beginning of the file name

 - `copy_filename`: copy the file name to clipboard
    - clipboard support requires xsel, xclip, or wl-copy
 - `copy_filename_without_extension`: copy the file name without the extension to clipboard
 - `copy_filepath`: copy the current file path to clipboard
 - `copy_dirpath`: copy the current directory path to clipboard

 - `set_mode`: Set read, write, execute permissions of current file
 - `touch`: create a new file or update the modified date of an existing file

## Search

 - `search`: search via string
    - case insensitive
 - `search_glob`: search via shell globbing
    - `:search_glob *.png`
 - `search_fzf`: search via fzf
 - `search_next`: go to next search result
 - `search_prev`: go to previous search result
 - `select`: select current file
    - `--toggle=true`: toggle the selected files
    - `--all=true`: selected all files
    - `--deselect=true`: deselect rather than select
    - `glob`: select files based on glob (just like `search_glob`)
       - `select *.png`

## Misc
 - `bulk_rename`: rename all selected files
    - this will create a file inside `$TMP_DIR` (or `/tmp` if `$TMP_DIR` is not set) and
      open up your text editor of choice via `$EDITOR` environment variable
    - once you've made your changes to the file, saved and quit, it will use the `mv` command to rename everything
